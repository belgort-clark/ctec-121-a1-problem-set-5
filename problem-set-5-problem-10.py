READ ALL INFORMATION CAREFULLY AND THEN READ IT AGAIN

IMPORTANT - PROVIDE AN IPO (Inputs, Processes, and Output) AT THE TOP OF THE PROGRAM USING COMMENTS.

- At the top of the program, include a section of comments that identifies all of the inputs, processes, and outputs for the program.
- Include comments within your code explaining what the code is doing. You don't need to comment every line.
- You must use coding techniques covered in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 in your solutions. Code from the internet will not be accepted.

Write a program that accepts a sentence as input and converts and converts each word to "Pig Latin." In one version, to convert a word to Pig Latin you remove the first letter and place that letter at the end of the word. Then you append the string "ay" to the word.

YOU MUST ASK FOR A SINGLE SENTENCE AS INPUT.

Here is an example:

English: I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT

Pig Latin: IAY LEPTSAY OSTMAY FOAY HETAY IGHTNAY

HINTS
========================
- Split the sentence into a list
- Iterate through each word using a loop
- Get the last character of each word and assign it to a variable
- Use string slicing to get the last character of each word
- Remove the first character from the word
- Append it to the end of the current word
- Use the accumulator pattern to build a string
